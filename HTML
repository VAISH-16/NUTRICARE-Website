                <p>
                    <div class="text"><h3>Our Mission</h3></div> Hi everyone! Welcome to NutricaRe - a food blog/website with delicious and healthy recipes. This blog/website is my way of sharing my passion for healthy and delicious food with the world. I'm not trying to lecture anyone to eat better or differently, I simply want to share my way of eating and living, and hopefully inspire some of you with my delicious and healthy recipes. Our mission is to simplify and democratize nutrition through technology for professionals (nutrionists,fitness trainers and doctors who are doing nutrition) and for their clients.<br></br>
                    <div class="text"><h3>Our Story</h3></div> Everything started during the lockdown period. We made our NutricaRe webpage on the current situation i.e COVID-19 where many peoples are dying and it still hasn't stopped yet. The main cause of people's death is improper diet and nutritional care which leads to low immunity. There is currently no guidance on the vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in healthy individuals or for the treatment of COVID-19. Nutrition is good for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being. We realized that we can simpliy the nutritional activity and after we talked with several nutritions, dietitians and doctors we identified a few problems.<br></br>
                    (1) Most of the the nutrionists are spending a lot of time because they do repetative tasks by hand. (2) Personalized Nutrition means a lot of boring calculations. (3) Communication between nutrionists and clients doesn't exist outside of the clinic or is poor.<br></br>
                    I beleive: GOOD NUTRITION SHOULD BE SIMPLE, FOOD SHOULD BE TASTY AND SATISFYING, HEALTH CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED BY ANY NUMBER,  & YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.
